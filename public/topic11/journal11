Transitions are very powefull effect. We need to understand the properties of a transition, which are five, and how to use them. It is very important to understand the duration os a transition.

CSS Transitions allows property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly over a specified duration.
Transitions - steps:
(1) define wha tproperties you want to apply a transition effect to (collor, padding, etc)
(2) define the trnasition duration
(3) define the timing-function that will control the transition animation specified
