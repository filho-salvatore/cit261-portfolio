TOPIC 12 -  Designing, Defining, and Triggering CSS3 Transforms without Custom Libraries (Thought Library). 

important to understand the difference between transformation and animation:
CSS transforms allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.
CSS transforms allows elements styled with CSS to be transformed in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space.

Designing
There are 2D transforms and 3D transforms
2D transforms
 methods: 
 translate: moves an elements
 rotate:   rotates an element clockwise or counter-clockwise according to a given degree.
 scaleX,scaleY,scale: increases or decreases the size of an element
 skewX,skewY,skew: skews an element the given angles
 matrix: combines all the 2D transform methods into one:
 matrix(scaleX(),skewY(),skewX(),scaleY(),translateX(),translateY())

3D transforms
take 3 arguments (x,y,z)
rotate only the angles
methods: 
translate3d, scale3d,
    rotateX()
    rotateY()
    rotateZ()
