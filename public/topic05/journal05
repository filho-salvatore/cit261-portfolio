TOPIC05 - Local Storage API, Storing and Retrieving Simple Data, Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects. 

studied local storage and session storage.
used w3 data to study and created two html pages to show the results
page 1 - only works with simple strings
page adv works with arrays and objects

it is simple to work with local and session storage. the methoods are the same, only changing the name from local to session and vice versa.
in order to get objects and arrays in and out from the storage we have to use JSON strigify and parse methods.
