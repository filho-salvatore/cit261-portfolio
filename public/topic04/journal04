 TOPIC04 -  Using XMLHTTPRequest to Consume a JSON Web Service
 
 
 when tried to use the  function I received the error:
 
 Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://cit261-portfolio.herokuapp.com/api/name' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. [file:///home/dono/projetos/cit261/cit261-portfolio/public/topic04/request.html]
 
 To solve it I had to add cors header to my response in express:
 I used both answers (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55229677/blocked-by-cors-policy-no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present-node ,
