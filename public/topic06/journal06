TOPIC06 - DOM Manipulation Using createElement, appendChild, insertBefore, removeChild, etc. 

studied about the DOM.
is is very interesting to think about the DOM as a tree.
we can add, modify,delete and find nodes in that tree.
when we add a node we need to know where to add.

I was studyng the DOM. 
I needed to add some attributes to the Elements.
In fact I wanted to add some method to some DOM element.
In other words I wnate dto extend the dom.
I have found this excelent tutorial explaining how doe it works.
It is how JQuery and other librries works.

I have built my Own DOM extension to work like jQuery, where I can use the $() to select objectos of te DOM and use my onw methods on them. Nice!!!
