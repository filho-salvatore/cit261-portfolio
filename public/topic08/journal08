understanf keyframes Animations

the @keyframes rule specifies the animation code.
The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.
one drawback of anymations is the browser support.
there are several different anymations and transform keywords, like -webkit-transform, -moz-transform, -ms-transform,-o-transform

-webkit-animation: 1600ms pulsingHeart infinite alternate ease-in-out;
    -moz-animation: 1600ms pulsingHeart infinite alternate ease-in-out;
    -ms-animation: 1600ms pulsingHeart infinite alternate ease-in-out;
    -o-animation: 1600ms pulsingHeart infinite alternate ease-in-out;
    animation: 1600ms pulsingHeart infinite alternate ease-in-out;

CSS transforms are currently supported with prefixes by these browsers:

Chrome 10+

Firefox 3.6+

Internet Explorer 9+

Opera 11+

Safari 5+

When declaring transforms always write the prefixed declarations first and the non-prefixed standard declaration at the end:

-webkit-transform: <transform functions>;
-moz-transform: <transform functions>;
-ms-transform: <transform functions>;
-o-transform: <transform functions>;
transform: <transform functions>;
