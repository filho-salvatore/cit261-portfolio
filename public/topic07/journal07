TOPIC07 - Manipulating CSS Class Properties Using JavaScript. 

read the chaper 07 from the book.
it teaches how to perform dynamic styling.
i have never loked Css before, it is an oportunity to learn it.

Each CSSStyleRule object is assigned a sequential index. As I explained in Chapter 2, the order that rules are included can affect how conflicts are resolved. The index is also important because youâ€™ll need this to remove a rule.

In order to do that it is necessary ti binf the class context to the event handler.
