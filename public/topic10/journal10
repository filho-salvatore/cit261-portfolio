 
TOPIC10 - HTML5 Tags - Video, Audio, and Canvas.

this week I spent my time learning how to control the video within javascript.
the mos hard par was to learn how to add the attributes control and autoplay to the video. But after I have learned I saw how simple it was.
To control video and sound within javascript makes it very powerful.
I was thinking that we can change the video source, video format and other attributes like youtube.
We can even play only the parts of the video we want.

I have learned how to use the canvas also.
It is nice to create games.
